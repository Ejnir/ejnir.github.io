By definition, "data science" must make meaning out of ever-growing pools of data. But the researcher quickly discovers that the hand examination of any data, while useful for granular analysis, is never adequate for large samples. To produce data science at scale, researchers must make effective use of workflows, pipelines, and processes to ingest, parse, and transform data with tools and automation.

This course will center on exposing students to contemporary pipelines for data analysis through a series of steadily escalating use cases. The course will begin with simple local database construction and evolve to cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS or Google Cloud. This progression will include learning a variety of systems for data collection, orchestration, transformation, consumption, and others as appropriate. We will be exposed to concepts of data wrangling, cleansing, ETL and some application of Machine Learning, though the focus of this course isn’t to teach that.

### Audience

This course will emphasize hands-on experience in the creation, management, and consumption of various computational services that support the practice of data science. For the purposes of getting started, I will assume that you fit roughly into at least one of three categories as you approach the subject:

1. Data Scientist / Researcher
2. Developer / CS
3. Data Engineer / Systems
4. Other – you are just stepping into this space and want to apply this to your major

### Grading

| Component                        | Weight | Notes / Due                                             |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Student Survey**                |        | First week of class                                     |
| **Lectures, readings and other material** |        | Weekly before class discussion                          |
| **Labs/Homework**                 | 30%    | Typically weekly based on reading and discussions       |
| **Class Participation**           | 5%     | We'll measure this through various methods              |
| **Quizzes**                       | 15%    | 3 or 4 quizzes, we'll see how it goes                   |
| **Data Projects**                 | 50%    | We will do two data projects over the semester and will not have a final |

- **Student Survey**: A simple questionnaire for me to ascertain baseline skills for the class and students' familiarity with a variety of tools and concepts.
- **Lectures / Reading / Viewing**: Will be posted beforehand. Though not a graded portion of the course, lectures, readings, and supporting videos have been carefully selected to introduce and explain important concepts to you. Should you not digest these, you will likely not perform well in the course. Lectures and all links will remain posted for the entire semester.
- **Labs**: Labs are an important way for you to interact with tools, code, and get some connection to what you are hearing and reading. I'll post those a week or so ahead, and you will have Wednesday to do them and turn them in by Friday of that same week. There are a lot of self-directed labs you can explore on your own as well.
- **Class Participation**: This can be interaction in class, extra writing, and group / peer review. Collaboration is an important part of functioning well.
- **Quizzes**: Quizzes will be short, multiple-choice assessments of your understanding of the material. These will generally be given periodically during the semester.
- **Data Projects**: Data projects are graded assignments that implement your understanding of course material. Projects will be posted one week before they are due.

### Office Hours

**T/Th**

My job is to serve you. I want to make myself as available as possible. While I’ll post office hours, please feel free to DM me to schedule time that you may need. We have a diverse set of students with various degrees of technical skills, so I’m happy to help as needed. Further, if you want to dive into career ideas, interview tips, or questions about what it’s like working for XYZ company, I’m here for that.

### Tools

Students in this course will be expected to use the following pieces of software on a weekly basis:

- **Discord**: Discord will serve as our hub for discussions, Q&A, and distributing extra material specific to topics or assignments. Download the software, create a Discord account, and join the class server.
- **Git/GitHub**: Students are expected to know how to version control their material using Git. Some programming assignments will require submission via commits pushed to GitHub.
- **Cloud**: All students will use Google accounts and credits for this course. We will get set up when the time comes.
- **Database**: We will also use locally installed instances of MySQL, MySQLite, and other tools. I will make a version available of MySQL on a server if you don’t wish to install locally. We will eventually use a cloud-based version as we progress.
- **Python**: Our coding will be in Python, and we will be using the Anaconda Navigator for our IDE and Python management.

## Student Action Items

- Create a free GitHub account.
- Install Git locally.
- Create a free Discord account and join the server.
- Make sure you are up and running Python. We will be doing everything in Python 10.

## Policies

### Honor Policy

The course will be conducted according to the UVA honor system. Programming assignments and exams are to be completed by the individual (no group collaborations). You will sign an honor pledge for all assignments, quizzes, and exams; more importantly, I expect you to adhere to the intent of the pledge. Cooperative efforts at understanding the material and technologies of the course are encouraged.

All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.

If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434)924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at [http://honor.virginia.edu](http://honor.virginia.edu).

### Disabilities or Learning Needs

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations.

### Other Policies

Further course policies can be found on the course's official website.
